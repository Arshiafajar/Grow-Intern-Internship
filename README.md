In this project, I developed a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Using an  imbalanced dataset, I first balanced it using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) and then applied  applied Logistic Regression to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
Key steps included data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report. This project aimed to enhance the detection accuracy and minimize false positives, ensuring a robust and reliable fraud detection system.
